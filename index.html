  <section>
  <p>Hello everyone, I'm Martin, also known as DocMcFly. I am a hobbyist and self-taught concept designer with a professional background in CAx technology and systems engineering. My work is influenced by 90's video games and Japanese internet pop culture. From a design perspective, I adhere to the principles of minimalism, particularly the design ethos of Japanese Industrial Designer Kenya Hara. Sometimes, I prototype my own industrial design ideas using my CNC milling machine. I do not follow a specific roadmap for my projects; instead, I often experiment with different tools and techniques. This website showcases my projects in concept design, graphics, coding, and prototyping.</p>

  <section>
          <p>[?] Are you a pro concept artist? ➜ No, I'm a hobbyist.<br>
[?] Do you take commissions? ➜ Not at the moment.<br>
[?] Wanna join our dope NFT project? ➜ WTF!? No!<br>
[?] Can I use your stuff to train my AI algorithm? ➜ STFU!<br>
[?] Do you use AI tools? ➜ Sometimes I experiment with CHaracter.AI or use ChatGPT for translations from English to Japanese.<br>
[?] Are you open for collaborations? ➜ It depends, I like to participate on community projects.<br>
[?] What 3D tools do you use? ➜ I mention them in my project descriptions.<br>
[?] Where do you want to go? ➜ The BACKLOG gives a small hint on my future projects.<br>
